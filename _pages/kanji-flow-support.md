### 1. Introduction
Welcome to the KanjiFlow Support Page. We're here to help make your experience using KanjiFlow as seamless and rewarding as possible. Here, you'll find information to address common questions and issues.

### 2. Getting Started
KanjiFlow is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly. To get started, simply select a JLPT level and start learning! Words will first appear in a "learning" mode with the English meaning and Japanese reading. After you've reviewed the word, it will later appear in "review" mode for you to recall.

### 3. Writing Kanji
KanjiFlow integrates kanji writing into the learning process. Words with kanji will prompt you to write each kanji, first with guidance, then by memory. This innovative approach aids your understanding and recall of both words and kanji.

### 4. Review Mode and Ratings
In review mode, words will reappear for you to recall. You can then rate your recall as "Easy", "Good", "Hard", or "I couldn't recall it". Based on your rating, the word's review schedule will be adjusted accordingly.

### 5. Issues and Bugs
In case of any issues or bugs, please contact us at kanjiflowapp@gmail.com. We appreciate your help in making KanjiFlow better.
